        "Which methods exist for orchestrating containerized applications with a focus on performance and/or energy efficiency optimization?",
        "Which type of orchestration policies results from the method and at what abstraction layer are they operating (machine level/ network level/ software level?",
        "Which type of resources are considered in the generation of the policies? (Overall CPU Utilization, Power consumption, Network throughput of the machines within a cluster.",
        "What are the limitations of existing methods?",
        "What are the benefits of these methods on resource utilization?"
