literature-study-pipeline
Overview

The literature-study-pipeline is an application designed to facilitate the process of conducting a literature study. Researchers can define their study design, including the research questions, and the pipeline processes relevant literature to extract information that answers those questions. This streamlined approach aids researchers in composing their papers based on the provided information.
Features

    Define literature study design with research questions
    Process literature and extract relevant information
    Provide structured information to answer research questions
    Simplify composition of research papers

Installation

To install literature-study-pipeline, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/literature-study-pipeline.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd literature-study-pipeline

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Defining a Literature Study Design

    Create a study design file (e.g., study_design.json):

    json

    {
        "study_name": "Example Study",
        "research_questions": [
            "What are the effects of X on Y?",
            "How does A influence B in context Z?"
        ],
        "inclusion_criteria": [
            "Published after 2010",
            "Peer-reviewed journals"
        ],
        "exclusion_criteria": [
            "Studies with less than 30 participants"
        ]
    }

    Save this file in the project directory.

Running the Pipeline

    Execute the main script with your study design file:

    bash

    python main.py --study_design study_design.json

    The pipeline will process the literature and generate a report containing the answers to your research questions.

Output

The output will be a structured report (e.g., report.json) with the following format:

json

{
    "study_name": "Example Study",
    "research_questions": [
        {
            "question": "What are the effects of X on Y?",
            "answers": [
                {
                    "source": "Journal of Example Studies",
                    "summary": "X has been shown to increase Y by 20% in controlled experiments."
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
